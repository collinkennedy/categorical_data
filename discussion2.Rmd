## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}



### If you have at least one # at the beginning of a line of code, it is considered as comments and not code
#Problem 1

#a)
(factorial(10)/(factorial(4)*factorial(3)*2))*0.1*0.3^4*0.2^3*0.4^2


factorial(10)/(factorial(4)*factorial(3)*2)
#b)
pbinom(2,10,0.1)

#compare
n=10
p=0.1
choose(n,0)*p^0*(1-p)^n+choose(n,1)*p^1*(1-p)^(n-1)+choose(n,2)*p^2*(1-p)^(n-2)

pbinom(2,n,p) #cdf of a binomial(n,p) evaluated at 2

#c)
#Expectation is n*p
n*p

#Problem 2
#b)
p=0.49
n=20

choose(n,1)*p*(1-p)^(n-1) #pmf at 1
dbinom(1,n,p) #pmf at 1

pbinom(1,n,p)-pbinom(0,n,p) #equivalent to pmf at 1 in binomial case


#c)
p=0.49
n=20

#P(Y>=8)
1-pbinom(7,n,p)

## Direct normal approximation
score=(7-n*p)/sqrt(n*p*(1-p))
1-pnorm(score)

#continuity correction
score=(7.5-n*p)/sqrt(n*p*(1-p))
1-pnorm(score)
